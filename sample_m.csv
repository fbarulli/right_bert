1,I bought the unknown deal usually unknown I think that Vic said would be everything I needed to have a complete affiliate marketing business in his ad on YouTube I know Im unknown to these kinds of marketing unknown but unknown with unknown 30 day 100 money back guarantee I jumped in I went through the entire course in less than a week because I knew I might want my money back and didnt want to risk losing that chance unknown system of having a hub and providing value to potential customers to get them to purchase through your affiliate links IS a good idea dont get me wrong but the way he goes about it has pretty scammy vibes The value youre providing to your potential customers is pretty much only selling other unknown products that are online courses to supposedly teach people how to be successful The way he talks about them is not focused on their actual value but instead that hes a great salesman and hell sell them for you though he does talk a lot about helping others its very clear thats only surface level and that the actual point of the system is to make A LOT of money It definitely occurs to you as you watch the video that unknown a great salesman and right now hes selling to ME The other way you can earn money through the hub is through your resources page which is essentially just a list of companies that youre supposed to go get an affiliate link for on your own but to get into some of the affiliate programs costs money some are unknown offered anymore and then a few of them I was able to get an affiliate link for In the template all the links are unknown to be unknown affiliate links and he specifically says over and over again in the video to not change the template if you cant get an affiliate link of your own for any of the companies listed Of course that means that all these links on all these unknown customers websites will be earning Vic himself more and more money because so many of them are unknown for most people unknown is a pretty good platform for unknown building but its one of many hidden expenses that he doesnt mention in his initial ad that promises everything you need for unknown Theres a pretty substantial monthly charge though I cant remember how much it was unknown I think And once you get deeper into the course you find out that theres an additional investment of somewhere between unknown and unknown to get all the resources that hes been talking about throughout the training Without these resources essentially what you have is a website with 2030 affiliate links in the form of a list and a streaming page where you can go live to sell to your customers yourself You can sell the additional unknown courses but youll get unknown on the dollar unless you pay a large chunk of change for 100 commission on those All the talk about his company providing the live events to draw people in is only available to you if you pay thousands more to be a platinum member or whatever they call it Overall Im absolutely positive that Vic has made millions of dollars with his unknown its on the backs of people who are willing to enter his system and keep drawing more and more people in kind of like a unknown scheme I do want to make passive money online which is why Im so unknown to these things but I will not be part of a system like this I requested a refund and got a pretty quick response with a letter from Vic asking me to stay in it and not quit and a link to an exit survey type form if I decided to go ahead with asking for the refund I filled out the form and never heard anything back not even a confirmation about the form submission About 10 days later I emailed customer service again and asked for the status of my refund and the rep said it hadnt been processed yet Later that day I received the refund Overall Im not sure that unknown deserves the label scam or anything but I wouldnt recommend them personally The whole thing felt like a money grab and who knows maybe I could have made millions with them But I couldnt get past the hard selling and the way I felt that what I was told would be included in the package I bought just wasnt included I refuse to do that to other people Id like to be able to go to bed at night without my conscience keeping me awake

1,Final unknown was made to return unit for refund as below unknown day unprofessional call about the unknown as it has been updated as they requested Basically called us liars That weve been treated fairly and no one was rude or yelled at us This company only cares about reviews Thats it The reason they have good reviews is bc they harass and bargain refunds for deleting reviews If they can put forth this effort over a review they could have put forth that effort to resolve the initial problem that created the review After deep diving into more reviews it appears we are far from alone in this Were keeping the broken unit I see several people unknown stood their ground and kept the review up and lost money but I dont see any thats 3500 unknown asked all communication from here out be emailed and that stopped their harassing calls unknown however theyve picked up again today hence this update Dont call me when you see Ive updated this Update to the review unknown me to clarify Yes you are able to get someone on the phone or to call back however theres been no solution to the problem until today The solution has been to try again the next day and maybe Im unreasonable but I need some kind of answer Even we dont know but will have and answer for you by Friday at noon would have been an acceptable response but I dont unknown back is ok Now for the update We received a call after calling the customer service line and being told no one was there call back tomorrow We then reached out to FB account where someone called us shortly thereafter We were told the process in which we needed to follow to return the unit At that point I had already left this review along with one other They wanted pictures of the unit installed 1 It was dark out at the time we received the call back 2 Im not installing a unit that doesnt work just to satisfy someone Nevertheless we decided we would unknown install it the next day to play the game they have requested but not actually drill holes into the coach An hour or so later we received a very unprofessional and unknown rude call from a representative over this review who repeatedly asked we take it down unknown to receive the full refund unknown the 30 restocking fee in exchange to remove this review I declined He said a supervisor would call the next day Next day a supervisor called my husband who was tied up with work and told them to call me I also was tied up with work In about 30 mins or so I did get free to call back In the meantime though I received a message on FB telling me that the rep came in early specifically for us and to call him back as soon as possible Once speaking with the rep who was calm this time I asked if we still had to talk to his supervisor or we were done He said he would transfer me despite me saying I didnt need to talk to anyone else if it was settled Regardless he couldnt transfer the call and said supervisor would call back He did so quickly however I had another call and missed it then answered it and couldnt hear anything When I called back he told me he wanted me to know hed just called me 6 times which I thought was a strange thing to say but let it go He assured us we can return and receive a full refund and apologized that this has been a mess We have been asked on repeat to delete this review since then and to be honest I dont know that I trust them to refund us anything I dont know that I want to send this back and risk getting zero money back and zero product At least for the moment we have something The cameras work its the remote viewing thats the issue I am beyond done with this Im also debating on turning over the recorded calls that I have to some upper management at the company but havent decided on that yet either Everyone has bad days and customer service is absolutely NOT fun and I am sure we have not been pleasant to deal with However this is not for personal use We have a coach waiting on install our own customer who we cant give any kind of solid answers nor timeline to bc we were not getting one from Tadi We still cant because we now how to order another system from another company when this is really what he wanted and who knows when it will show unknown ridiculous Dont buy from these people We have been on the phone for three days and every day its a fight to get someone Theyve always left for the day and have to call back tomorrow 3500 system that will not work and I dont think we should be calling for days trying to get a resolution The lady that answers the customer service line is the only person to consistently answer the phone and attempt to help

2,I selected Brian Gavin Diamonds for a diamond and custom engagement ring The initial shopping process was decent i typically got an email response to a question within 2 days After some unknown back and forth with a sales rep I decided on a stone and outlined unknown what i was looking for in a custom setting I was told after I paid for the diamond and setting we would start a design process to make my ring design into a model After I paid was when the problems started 15 days after paying with no consultation no call no email they sent me a CAD model of the ring I assume it was based on notes from the sales rep it was the basic idea but there were several changes I wanted to make I reached right back out with some design ideas figuring this was the beginning of the design process 10 days passed nothing happened no call no email I sent an email checking in About 10 more days passed and they sent me a picture of the completed ring I was a bit blown away at this point Here is an unknown of an email I sent at that point So is that final Can changes still be made Again Im feeling like I was told that this would be collaborative I would be part of the design process and yet I got one set of CAD images and then they cast a ring I never approved anything I was never asked is this what you want Im having a hard time with this Why did I pay for a custom setting when I could have found the same thing at blue unknown brilliant earth etc whats the value add here Is there any part of this process where I actually approve or sign off on any thing I got a response saying Brian Gavin wanted to speak on the phone I spoke with Brian explained my concerns and the changes I was hoping to have included in the design I had a vision for this ring but there never was a design session or consultation call so now it had been cast and it was not what I wanted He let me know that they might be able to accommodate some of them but definitely not all of them Brian had me print out a picture of the ring they sent me and draw the changes I wanted on the image I unknown He told me he would make a unknown image of the changes I asked for that they could accommodate for my approval i never got that image About a week later we spoke again He told me the changes they would make and that it was going back into the shop soon for those changes I asked about the other changes the ones they apparently couldnt make because they had cast the ring without my approval and he tried to tell me the ring was small and the little details that were important to me would barely be visible he explained he didnt want to have to unknown the ring I figured there would be another follow up with the final product for approval before shipping There wasnt The next correspondence I got was the shipping notification I was out of town for Easter weekend when they sent it The Fedex insured policy that they used had a 48 hour holding time at the Fedex facility I had to leave my family Easter early to get back before the Fedex store closed that Monday otherwise it would have been shipped back This was exceptionally frustrating because during the sale I was sold on the idea that this was a high touch custom process for the highest quality product The ONLY time they were highly responsive was when I told them I was looking at other vendors they sent me a long unknown email about the quality of their diamonds and settings and how this was such an important investment and I bought into it Shame on me because what good is a high quality product if it isnt the product you want I sincerely feel like after I paid they were just trying to get the ring out the door with as little work and communication approvals as possible I got the ring it was not exactly what I wanted but it will be fine Needless to say after saving 3 months salary and unknown over what design would be perfect this has made what should have been an exciting process for me one I would rather forget I gave 2 stars because allegedly this is a high quality stone and setting who knows I wish I had gone with another provider who actually lived up to their word and showed me they cared about what I wanted I paid for a custom ring but didnt really get one I paid for quality service but didnt get it I regret selecting Brian Gavin and would not recommend them to anyone

3,Darwins was early on the raw food market and provided a good service But there were usually aggravating problems leaking packages unknown unknown Im the first one to acknowledge that there can be different standards for food for dogs and people But why not go out of your way to raise the standard and stay above criticism Our dog has been sick ever since the last recall The lot numbers on food we fed her didnt match but were packaged on the same date Her vet bills have been in the thousands of dollars The time and effort involved in caring for her and working out a new diet have been extraordinary I dont know if theres a connection to Darwins but had the company not been so casual about its practices it would not be even unknown

3,The content of the course was good however the organization of the slides did not flow very well The information skipped around which made it hard to keep straight One slide would be discussing something from the unknown process and then the next slide would talk about closing out the project The slides should start at the beginning and work their way through a project Also the modules were too lengthy so you couldnt chunk the work up very well Instead of 180 and 160 slides break it into smaller modules based on the life cycle of the project and have the order of the slides flow with unknown
